## AI-Assisted Slide Creation

AutoDeck ships with `SKILL.md` — a tool-agnostic guide any AI coding assistant can read:

```
# In Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, or Gemini:
"Read SKILL.md and help me create slides for a talk about [your topic]"
```

The AI understands all 10 slide types, animations, multi-language patterns, and quality requirements. `SKILL.md` also includes generation recipes to produce a full TechBrief or UIMockup from a codebase or design brief.

## Edit Mode & LLM Notes

AutoDeck's `PresentationViewer` has two distinct experiences:

- **Live Mode** (default) — a clean, viewer-safe surface. Only the Share button and the Edit toggle are visible; theme, background, and language controls are absent from the DOM.
- **Edit Mode** — a developer workspace that reveals all controls (theme, background, language, creation-story) plus a per-slide **Notes** panel.

**Toggle:** click the Eye/Pencil pill in the top-right cluster, or press `E` anywhere in the viewer.

**Slide Notes** are freeform text annotations persisted in `localStorage` per deck. They are designed as a structured LLM handoff: capture feedback while reviewing a deck, then export it all as a markdown blob and apply it in one batch.

**LLM handoff workflow:**

1. In Edit Mode, add notes to individual slides as you review the deck.
2. Open the Notes panel and click **Export Notes for LLM** — copy to clipboard or download as `slide-notes.md`.
3. In Claude Code, run `/apply-slide-notes` and paste the markdown blob; the skill proposes an edit per note and asks for confirmation before writing.

**Opt-out for shared/production decks:** set `editModeEnabled: false` on `PresentationConfig` to remove the Edit toggle entirely — even a direct `localStorage` write cannot activate Edit Mode in that session.

```typescript
const config: PresentationConfig = {
  title: 'Q3 Investor Deck',
  editModeEnabled: false,   // Edit toggle hidden from all viewers
}
```
